### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tarek Amr. I consider myself a software "craftsman", with a Machine Learning twist.

ðŸ“š I've recently published a book on Machine Learning using Python and Scikit-Learn. The book is called [Hands-On Machine Learning with scikit-learn and Scientific Python Toolkits](https://amzn.to/2Kp4UYD). Earlier, I wrote another book on Data Visualization using JavaScript and D3.js, the book is called [Practical D3.hs](https://amzn.to/37CuHW9).
